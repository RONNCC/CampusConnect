		<p> We strive to be as clear as possible about how we use your data. When you sign up for an account, the information you use to register, and no more, is recorded. Unless required by law, your information will not be shared with third parties. The details of our privacy policy are outlined below. </p> <br> <br>

		<h2> Information Collection and Usage </h2> 

		<p> The personal information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations. <br><br>

		Your personal information stored on this website may be shared with your explicit permission or under the following circumstances:
		It becomes necessary to share your information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. <br><br>

		Any additional information provided via e-mail, external communications, and/or surveys will not be shared with third parties without your consent unless stated otherwise within the communication or survey. <br><br>

		Content submitted by any user (Job Creators submit jobs to be done and Job Seekers submit skills and accept jobs posted), is publicly available to all users of the application. Reviews are also publicly available to all users of the application. Once a job is completed, both the user who posted the job and the user who did the job will have a record of the job in their account history, but the job may be removed from public visibility to reduce clutter and promote relevant, active jobs. <br><br> </p>

		<h2> Cookies </h2>

		<p> Cookies are only used to manage session information (to keep you logged in). The cookie itself only has an ID associated with the session, and the session data itself is securely stored on our servers. <br> <br> </p>

		<h2> Data Storage </h2>

		<p> CampusConnect uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run this application. By using this service, you consent to the transfer and storage of any information provided to this application to our infrastructure. Password information is encrypted and will be unable to view by any party, including us! <br> <br> </p>

		<h2> Changes </h2>

		<p> Users will be notified of any changes to this privacy policy either through the application or a notice to the e-mail address associated with the user account. <br><br> </p>

		<h2> Email </h2>

		<p> Users may be emailed by administrators upon major application updates, security issues, account management issues, terms of service updates, and/or privacy policy updates. You will never be e-mailed for advertisement or news purposes. <br><br>

		Users may also opt-in to email notifications related to active job requests or jobs currently ongoing. <br><br> </p>

		<h2> Questions </h2>

		<p> Any questions about this Privacy Policy should be sent to the information on our <a href="/pages/contact">Contact Us page here.</a> </p>
